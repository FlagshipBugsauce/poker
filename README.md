# Poker Backend
Backend for an online, multiplayer, browser-based, poker game using Angular and Spring Boot.

## Basic Setup:
1. Download and install MongoDB Server.
  * The community edition of Mongo should be fine.
  * Link: https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community
  * Recommended to install as a "service" - it will ask you if you want to do this during the installation.
  * Recommended to install Mongo Compass as well. It is not necessary and there are other tools that do the same thing, but it's a useful tool to have if you've got nothing else and it is lightweight and easy to use.
  * Link: https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/compass
2. Install Postman to help with testing endpoints.
3. Recommended to use Intellij for server development. 
  * You can get the full version with a student license.

4. Clone the repo. Recommended to create a directory for both the frontend and backend and clone both projects into this directory.

## Short-Term Goals
* I want to get a simplified game up and running. 
* The "game" I have in mind for the short-term, will simply select a player at random and proclaim them the winner.
* The point here, is to first focus on all the infrastructure necessary to facilitate a more complex game, such a NL Hold 'em. Once all this infrastructure is in place, the game logic can become the primary focus of development.
* This infrastucture consists of things like user registration and login, the ability to create and start games, etc...

## Current TODO:
Check the "Projects" tab (or check "Issues"). This is where you can find things that need to be done.
