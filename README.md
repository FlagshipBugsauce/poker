Frontend for an online, multiplayer, browser-based, poker game using Angular and Spring Boot.

## Note
* It is recommended that you clone this repo and get it running even if you're not planning to do client work.
* The client will allow you to test your changes to the backend much more easily than using Postman or Swagger in many cases.

## Basic Setup
* In order to run the client, you will need Node.js. Get the latest version.
    * Link: https://nodejs.org/en/
* Once node is installed, it is recommended you install the Angular CLI.
    * Install using the terminal command `npm install -g @angular/cli`
