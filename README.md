# Poker

This repository has two projects in it. I merged them together because I found that server changes often required client changes, 
and vise-versa. Instead of making one branch on the client repo and another on the server repo, I can just make one branch on this repo,
do whatever work I need to do and then commit that. It also makes it easier to track what is going on, since issues can include both
client and server work.
