# PokerClient

Frontend for an online, multiplayer, browser-based, poker game using Angular and Spring Boot.

## Note
* It is recommended that you clone this repo and get it running even if you're not planning to do client work.
* The client will allow you to test your changes to the backend much more easily than using Postman or Swagger in many cases.

## Basic Setup
* In order to run the client, you will need Node.js. Get the latest version.
    * Link: https://nodejs.org/en/
* Once node is installed, it is recommended you install the Angular CLI.
    * Install using the terminal command `npm install -g @angular/cli`

## Working on the Project:
* **DO NOT** work directly on the develop (or master) branch. 
   * Any work you do **MUST** be done on your own branch.
   * You should create a new branch for each issue you work on.
   * Once you're done your task, submit a pull request and only merge the branch you've worked on to the develop branch after it's approved.
* **DO NOT** merge anything to the develop (or master) branch until you create a pull request and it is approved.
   * If you do not know how to create a pull request, ask someone or google it (it's very simple).
* You can work on any of the issues found in the "To Do" section of the project board. 
* If there is something that needs to get done but no issue has been created, then create the issue yourself and add it to the project board.
* When you start working on something, move the associated issue to the "In Progress" section so that everyone knows the issue is being worked on.
* Feel free to update issues, add requirements, add issues, etc... Just try to keep things organized.
* You should be able to associate your pull requests with an issue and once your request is merged, the issue should automatically be moved to the "Done" section. If this doesn't happen for some reason, then move it manually so everyone knows the issue is finished.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
